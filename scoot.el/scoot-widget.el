WIDGET-TYPE is used to delegate to the correct widget-implementation, which in

CONTENT should be a single string formatted with \"\\n\" as line separators,
if allowed/appplicable.

The resulting buffer is an invisible buffer containing the editable content,
and is used to execute editing and movement commands without the need to
take the padding and property rules of the display buffer into consideration.

The buffer is assigned to a presumably buffer-local variable of the
buffer from which this function was invoked, chosen by the WIDGET-TYPE
widget implementation, which should typically be `scoot-result-mode`
buffer."
