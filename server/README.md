# Scoot Server

**Scoot Server** provides an HTTP JSON API for interacting with SQL databases, powered by the shared `scoot-core` backend. 
It is primarily intended for use by the Scoot Emacs mode (`scoot-el`), but can also be used independently to build custom 
tools or remote database workflows.

## Features

- Exposes a REST-like API over HTTP
- Handles connection management and query execution via SQLAlchemy
- Lightweight and suitable for local or remote use
- JSON input/output for easy integration with editors and scripting tools

## Installation

```bash
# Inside the monorepo, from the root or scoot-server/
pip install .
```

## Running the Server

```bash
python -m scoot_server -port 8000
```

- `--p`: Port to run the server on (default: 8221)

## API Overview

Scoot Server maintains stateful database connections that must be registered before use. This is done via the /api/connection endpoint by supplying a connection name and a SQLAlchemy-compatible URL. Subsequent API requests reference the registered connection by name as part of the request path.

This design allows the server to manage multiple active connections concurrently, each identified by name, and keeps client requests lightweight and reusable.

| `/api/<connection_name>/tables/<table_name>` | GET    | Returns schema info for a table              |
| `/api/<connection_name>/databases`           | GET    | Returns list of databases                    |
| `/api/<connection_name>/schemas`             | GET    | Returns list of schemas                      |
